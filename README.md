## Control Flow
Order in which lines of code are executed 

# Sequential control flow
Execution of code statements one after another, in the order they appear in the program

# Conditional control flow / control flow
Execution of code statements based on some input

if tomorrow == Saturday:
    set alarm for 7
if tomorrow is Tuesday:
    set alarm for 6

# Boolean Data Type Re-visit
Data type that has two values: True and False. Boolean values are used to control the flow of the program.

is_the_earth_flat = False

# Comparison Operators / Relational Operators
Decide the relationship between the operands. Result of comparison is a boolean value (True/False)

# if, elif, else
Simplest form of AI (you could say that)
'if' checks the condition, if true, the intended blocks get executed, if false, it skips the intended blocks

today = "Tuesday"

if today == "Monday":
    print("Set an alarm for 5AM!")
elif today == "Tuesday":
    print("Set an alarm for 6AM!")
elif today == "Saturday":
    print("Set an alarm for 7AM!")

# pass
Does nothing, just...passes..for now

# Boolean Operators
AND, OR, NOT. Operators need to be boolean as well
